# OC-EFI-Zenbook-UX434-FAC
This is the EFI folder I use.  
For Intel GFX only. It's an early stage, possibly with bugs, but it works so far.

With working FN key-lock.  
Audio, brightness keys are working.   
F6  =  Screenpad toggle on/off.  
F8  = Show Desktop.  
F12 = Start Music Play/Pause.  
FN + A = Screenpad brightness.  
FN + Space = Battery health charging 80% / 100%.  

I use Ventura, Monterey should also work. For BigSur you need the customized [AirportItlwm.kext](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases/).   
Please generate your own Serial, ROM, MLB, UUID.  

So far nearly everything works!!??   
Edit:
The webcam does not work yet.

Will upload more updates when I have time.

# OC-EFI-Zenbook-UX434-FAC
This is the EFI folder I use. 
With Intel GFX only. It's an early stage, possibly with bugs, but it works so far.

With working FN key-lock.  
Audio, brightness keys are working.   
With F6 the Screenpad can be enabled and disabled.  
F8  = Show Desktop.  
F10 = Disable/enable brightness.  
F12 = Start Music Play/Pause.  
FN + A = Screenpad brightness.  
FN + Space = Battery health charging 80%/100%.  

Add your own Serial, ROM, MLB UUID.  

So far nearly everithing works!!??   
Will upload more updates when I have time.
